                    <div class="text">Beginning</div>
                    <p>I began working here as a 'Graphic Designer' in the beginning and my job was to convey the message and objective of the startup to people through my design.
                        <br><br>
                        As the objective was to build to an application for people who would like to buy, lend and borrow books as this will help them to generate income while preserving their interest/hobby.
                        Therefore to accomplish this, graphics beign used must include elements that represent this inerest of the target users.
                        <br><br>
                        This idea of ours can be seen in the graphic used in the coming soon poster of the application, where a cat is drowsing while readling.
                    </p>

                    <div class="text">Journey</div>
                    <p>Once the application was launched now the objective for the design was to gain attention of maximum users.
                        <br><br>
                        Along with the marketing team we designed posters, standees, letter heads, etc. in order to publicise the application. Now, the social media posts were about promoting new features that were being incorporated in the application.
                        A series of posts was also done for suggesting books of various genres to the people, also user feedbacks were simulatenously being collected for improving the user experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Tried to incorporate trending happenings in our posters for gaining maximum reach from the online audience.

                    <div class="text">INTO USER Interface</div>
                    <p>The application launched in phase one had user feedbacks reporting issues in user interface and experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Senior designers in the team took upon the task of redesigning the application and I was given a chance to work with the team to achieve the same.
                        Brief about the application workflow was discussed among the team and framework was designed under the guidance of team lead was being followed thorughout.
                        <br><br>
                        Some features like genre selection, filtering the search and error messages were included by me.

                    <div class="text">Ananlysing the previous Version</div>
                    <p>We started with analysing the previous application in order to understand the workflow more efficiently and find out drawbcks in it.
                        <br><br>
                        Onboarding process of the application was not user friendly and necessary changes were made in it. Further we discussed of the new features that can be include in the application and some of them were including filters in search option and adding favorite genres.
                        <br><br>
                        Making the transaction flow better was also a necessary task which was taken by team lead.
                    </p>

                <div class="column case1" style="margin-top: 100px;">

                    <div class="text">Concluding</div>
                    <p>
                        This application was first time when I got to work with the 'User Interface' and came to know about workflows and user experience.
                        <br><br>
                        On a whole we were able to tackle all the issues that were faced by the users in previous version of the application. This was when I understood the importance of setting up a design system (colors, typograghy, illustrations).
                        Even placement of a small icon can make a huge difference in User Experience and learnt that this is not restricted only to applicati/websites, user experience can be incorporated in every form of designing.
                        <br><br>
                        Gained knowledge of how industry level designing works in comparison to individual work.
